This is the season we profess to dread. We think gray skies
mean brown food. But it's not true. Fruit and vegetable counters
are splattered with colour: glowing persimmons, mandarins and clementines,
and candy-pink early rhubarb. Cold weather makes us crave internal
central heating and we want psychological succour, too, so our
appetites become conservative. Although it's a fantasy, we feel we need
to eat for survival.
